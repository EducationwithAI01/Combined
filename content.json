    "paragraph": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence. These tasks include understanding language, recognizing images, solving problems, and making decisions. AI is used in many everyday applications like virtual assistants, recommendation systems, and self-driving cars. It often relies on large amounts of data and algorithms to learn and improve over time, making it smarter with more use.",

    "paragraph": "AI systems learn from data through a process called training, where algorithms analyze patterns and make predictions. This process can be supervised, where the data includes correct answers, or unsupervised, where the system finds patterns without labels. One of the key goals in AI is to make accurate decisions based on new, unseen data. Over time, well-trained AI models can become highly efficient at tasks like voice recognition, translation, and even diagnosing diseases.",
