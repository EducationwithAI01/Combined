    "paragraph": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence. These tasks include understanding language, recognizing images, solving problems, and making decisions. AI is used in many everyday applications like virtual assistants, recommendation systems, and self-driving cars. It often relies on large amounts of data and algorithms to learn and improve over time, making it smarter with more use.",
